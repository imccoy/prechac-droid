The only change is in Compound.toString():
 - return quotedName() + (args.length > 0 ? "(" + Term.toString(args) + ")" : "");
 + return this.name + (args.length > 0 ? "(" + Term.toString(args) + ")" : "");

If you're seeing stack overflow exceptions when things go wrong in prolog land,
plonk a breakpoint in Query.get1() where the prolog exception is initially
brought into javaland and see what's up.
