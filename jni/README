This folder is mostly the .c and .h files from swi-prolog's src/ directory, as
at revision 8c768b7310a97c0927d4297d09243155b9461da5.

It includes .ic and .ih files resulting from a compilation run. The config.h was
initially generated, but then altered as neccessary.

It also contains SWI-Stream.h from the include/ directory.

jpl.c comes from swi-prolog/packages/jpl/src/c/jpl.c

There's a few small changes:
  * commented out the alloca bit in pl-incl.h
  * added <fcntl.h> include to pl-thread
  * skipped tai and term from DECL_PLISTs and REG_PLISTs in pl-ext.c
  * skip open_xterm in PL_extension foreigns
  * skip cleanupTerm in pl-init.c's cleanupProlog
  * changed chflags |= REP_MB to chflags |= REP_UTF8 in os/pl-files.c
