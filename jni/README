This folder is just the .c and .h files from swi-prolog's src/ directory, as
at revision 8c768b7310a97c0927d4297d09243155b9461da5.

It includes .ic and .ih files resulting from a compilation run. The config.h was
initially generated, but then altered as neccessary.

It also contains SWI-Stream.h from the include/ directory.

There's a few small changes:
  * commented out the alloca bit in pl-incl.h
  * added <fcntl.h> include to pl-thread
  * skipped tai, term and termhash from DECL_PLISTs and REG_PLISTs in pl-ext.c
  * skip open_xterm in PL_extension foreigns
