This folder is mostly the .c and .h files from swi-prolog's src/ directory, as
at version 6.6 (revision a49fce60377948cb383d1abb5059da866b47c812).

It includes .ic and .ih files resulting from a compilation run. The config.h was
initially generated, but then altered as neccessary.

It also contains SWI-Stream.h from the include/ directory.

jpl.c comes from swi-prolog/packages/jpl/src/c/jpl.c

There's a few small changes:
  * commented out the alloca bit in pl-incl.h
  * added <fcntl.h> include to pl-thread
  * skipped tai and term from DECL_PLISTs and REG_PLISTs in pl-ext.c
  * skip open_xterm in PL_extension foreigns
  * skip cleanupTerm in pl-init.c's cleanupProlog
  * changed chflags |= REP_MB to chflags |= REP_UTF8 in os/pl-files.c
    get_file_name
  * changed jni/os/pl-text.c's PL_mb_text function so
        if ( text->encoding != target )
    becomes
        if ( text->encoding != target &&
              !(text->encoding == ENC_ISO_LATIN_1 && target == ENC_ANSI) )
