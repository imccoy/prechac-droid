This repo contains enough stuff to start up a prolog interpreter
and invoke prechacthis through the Prolog JPL and the android
NDK. Right now, it's kind of a hack.

It contains a patched version of the swi-pl interpreter (the
changes are described in jni/README) and a version of prechacthis
that has had the important bits (for some definition of important)
combined into a single file (res/raw/prechacthis.pl). That file
also includes some predicate definitions taken from swi-pl's list
library.

It works in genymotion (ie, android running on x86). I haven't tried
it on ARM yet. An arm-specific boot file may need to be generated.

Things to do:

* pull the swi-pl changes out into something that'll be easier
  to maintain as swi-pl changes
* make the swi-pl library functions available in a less ridiculous
  way
* incorporate prechacthis code in a less preposterously unmaintable
  way
* add a UI to create prechacthis queries
* add a UI to interpret prechacthis results
