This repo contains enough stuff to start up a prolog interpreter
and invoke prechacthis through the Prolog JPL and the android
NDK. Right now, it's kind of a hack.

It contains a patched version of the swi-pl interpreter (the
changes are described in jni/README) and a version of prechacthis
that has had the important bits (for some definition of important)
combined into a single file (res/raw/prechacthis.pl). That file
also includes some predicate definitions taken from swi-pl's list
library.

It works in genymotion (ie, android running on x86) and on
arm (2013 Nexus 7).

Right now, the user interface is really awful.

Things to do:

* pull the prolog query invocation stuff into a service (or something)
  so that you can rotate the device while the patterns are being generated
  and have that not be a disaster. (also: don't crash if you run a second
  query)
* rather than generating 1000 results and stopping, generate two screenfuls
  worth of results, then generate some more once the user scrolls down
* show some sort of indication when there are no results
* add a UI to interpret prechacthis results, with some of the niceties
  that the website has
* de-dup the results (I just saw a set that included both 11p2p4 and 1p2p41)
* pull the swi-pl changes out into something that'll be easier
  to maintain as swi-pl changes
* make the swi-pl library functions available in a less ridiculous
  way
* incorporate prechacthis code in a less preposterously unmaintable
  way
* improve the query UI
